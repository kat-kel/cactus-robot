# Analyze Links in Twitter

This program parses collections of URLs in the format of Twitter API's export 
and/or Gazouilloire, a collecting tool from Science Po's m√©dialab. It extracts
URLs from the collection and yields a CSV file with metadata about valid links.

Twitter and Gazouilloire store URLs in the column 'links' and this program will
search that column by default. But if you want to execute the analysis on a dataset
with URLs stored under a different column, you can declare it with the option -s.

    ```

    2. Analyze links in one Twitter/Gazouilloire export.
